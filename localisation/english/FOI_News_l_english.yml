foinews.1.desc: "Finally, after a long insurrection of far-right and far-left Militias, the Canadian Garrison has left Michigan, leading very quickly to the collapse of the ruling Military Junta which seized power to deal with said Militia issue. Instead, smaller warlord states remain in its place. Canadian power, as well as that of the wider Bermuda Accord, has been put into question, and hard questions will need to be asked."
foinews.1.a: "A Blow to Bermuda"
